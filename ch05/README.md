# Chapter 5: Multi-Token Prediction and FP8 Quantization

This chapter covers two key innovations for improving DeepSeek's training and inference efficiency. First, we explore Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), a technique that accelerates inference by predicting several tokens at once. Second, we dive into DeepSeek's advanced FP8 quantization framework, which trades precision for significant gains in speed and memory without sacrificing performance.
